Interactive Light Control
A simple web application demonstrating basic interactive design using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project features five virtual lights that can be individually toggled on or off using corresponding buttons.

Features
Five Interactive Lights: Displayed as circular elements that change state between "on" and "off."
Dynamic Control: Each lightâ€™s state updates in real-time based on button presses.

Technologies Used
HTML: Structures the page with elements for lights and buttons.
CSS: Styles the lights and buttons, including animations for state transitions.
JavaScript: Manages the logic for toggling light states and updating the UI dynamically.
